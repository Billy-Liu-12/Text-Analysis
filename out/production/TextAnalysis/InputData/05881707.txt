Research on Stock?s Trend After Raising Limit Based  on Multi-level Association Rule

Abstract?Stocks transaction accumulated a large number of history data. Analyzing these data and finding out correlations is very important for investors to make policy. It can avoid operating blindly. China adopts raising limit policy based on immaturity of China stock market. These artificial limits send a massage to investors that raising limit is connected with trend in days to come. This paper analyses stock?s data after raising limit and find out the correlations of raising limit with trend in days to come using multi-level association rule. Also make invest proposal to stock of raising limit.

Keywords- raising limit; multi-level association rule; stock analysis

I.  INTRODUCTION The policy of raising limit originates from early immature  stock market abroad. It is a transaction institution which appropriate limit increase of stock?s price in the same day for stopping over speculate and skyrocket or crash of stock?s prices in stock market. Actual raising limit policy in China stock market enforce from Dec.26 1996. Its purposes is holding market stabilization and making market further standardization.

The institution provides: expect the first day of listing, the amount of increase of closing price in one day to previous day of stocks (includes A-share and B-share) and funds can not exceed 10%. Entrustment which exceeds limit is invalid entrustment.

Raising limit is an artificial restricts stock price policy. So whether the stock price has been limited may jump the traces and keep increasing in one day or five days in the future is an important problem by using statistic analysis. Raising limit is an opportunity for current investment. The message sent by raising limit is connected with the trend in the coming days.

This relation can be found out by using the principle and algorithm of multi-level association rule and by founding model with the development of modern information technology and data mining technology. This relation can be transformed into current investment income based on time series model [1].

For example: A stock raising limit then its increasing probability in the coming day is 80%, so the investment will be success with 80% probability. This is single-level association rule. But the trading volume is different for stocks of raising limit. The increasing probability of decreasing trading volume  is 80% and of increasing trading volume is 60%. Then choosing the higher probability stocks can gain lower invest risk. This is multi-level association rule.



II. DATA PRETREATMENT This paper adopts download data from Guangfa stock  trading software. The research samples include all of Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 Index constituent stocks which are typical.

It analyses all the 50 stocks? day trading data from 2008 to 2009. Trading data includes: stock code, date, opening price, closing price, maximum price, minimum price, trading volume.

For easing to research, it is also necessary to transform the metric data into the trend data for all of these trading data.

These trend data includes: increasing rate, increasing rate of one day later, increasing rate of five days later, average of five days move trading volume, rate of trading volume exceed average, rate of price differential, rate of price differential of one day later. All of these trend data are need to calculate by these formulas below [2].

1) Increasing rate = (day closing price-previous day closing price) / previous day closing price?100  2) Increasing rate of one day later = (closing price of one day later-day closing price) / day closing price?100  3) Increasing rate of five days later = (closing price of five days later-day closing price) /day closing price?100  4) Average of five days move trading volume = (previous 4 days trading volume + day trading volume) /5  5) Rate of trading volume exceed average = (day trading volume-average of five days move trading volume) /average of five days move trading volume?100  6) Rate of price differential = (maximum price-opening price) /opening price?100  7) Rate of price differential of one day later = ( maximum price of one day later-opening price of one day later) /opening price of one day later?100  All of trading data are inputted into EXCEL program and form a data base like Table I.

TABLE I.  STOCK DAY TRADING DATA BASE (SECTION)    Definition 1: Stock trading data base D= {S1, S2? Sn}, means the history trading data of stock i among D. n=50 means all of Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 Index constituent stocks.

Si= {Ai, t, R1, R2? Rm}, Ai is the stock code of Si, t is the data, m=13 means above 13 kinds of metric data, Rj means the kind of j of trading data. Each Si is a group of discrete type data [3].



III. MULTI-LEVEL ASSOCIATION RULE MODEL Definition 2: I= {i1, i2? im} is an assembly of all items, D  is the affairs data base, affair T is a subset of items (T ? I), each affair has an only affair identification Tid. If A is a assembly consist of items, A is called itemset. If itemset A includes k kinds of items, it is called k-itemset. The percentage of the number of times of itemset A appears in D is called support (itemset A). If support (itemset A) exceeds minimum_support which is given by user, it is called frequent itemset.

Association rule is a logical implication formula like X Y (X ? I, Y ? I and X ? Y=? ). If there are s% affairs include X ? Y in affairs data base D, the support of association rule X Y is s%. In actually, support is a probability value. If support of itemset X is called support(X), the confidence of association rule is a conditional probability [4].

support(X Y)=P(X ? Y)                      (1) confidence(X Y)= P(Y|X)                     (2)  Definition 3: The association rule of different concept level is considered in most of time because of many affairs divide into different sorts. So the association rule created on many concept levels is called multi-level association rule. The data mining method of multi-level association rule based on the frame of support-confidence always adopts top-down depth- first policy. It starts from concept level-0 to lower level which is more specific. Frequent itemset of each concept level is summated, until cannot find out frequent itemset. For each level, any algorithm can be used to find out frequent itemset, for example Apriori algorithm and its transformation [5].

The multi-level association rule model in this paper can be represented by Figure 1.

In figure 1, D includes 4 items, X is the stocks of raising limit, Y is the stocks of day increasing, Z is the stocks of five days increasing, W is the stocks of rate of price differential >2%. X is connected with Y, Z and W. The support and confidence can be calculated. According to day trading volume X divide into 6 sorts: trading volume exceeds average <-50%, <-25%, [-25%,+25%], >25%, >50%, >100%. According to day increasing rate Y divide into 4 sorts: day increasing, day increasing >2%, >5%, limit. Z divide into 4 sorts: five days increasing >2%, >5%, >10%, >20%. W divide into 3 sorts:  price differential >2%, >5%, >10%. Because stock trade need 2% procedure fee, so 2% is a very important indicator which sign whether the stock trade is success.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION ALGORITHM The implementation of association rule adopts classical  Apriori algorithm. This algorithm uses breadth-first searching method. Frequent itemsets are produced in candidate assembly, and then association rule will be produced by frequent itemset.

First this algorithm gets the count of each item by scanning data base. Then it chooses the items which content minimum support condition, then form frequent 1-itemset which is called L1. Then find out L2 from L1, and find out L3 from L2, until cannot find out frequent k-itemset [6] [7].

Apriori algorithm expresses as follow:  L1={ frequent 1-itemset }  For(k=2;Lk-1 ? ;k++) do begin Ck=apriori_gen(Lk-1);  //new potential frequent itemset  for all transactions t?D do begin Ct=subset(Ck,t);  // potential frequent itemset in t  for all candidates c?Ct do c.count++;  end;  Lk={c? Ck|c.count minsup} end;  answer=Uk kL function apriori_gen() among Apriori algorithm is  insert into Ck  select p[1], p[2], , p[k-1], p[k]  from Lk-1p, Lk-1q  where p[1]=q[1], , p[k-2]=q[k-2], p[k-1]<q[k-1];  for all itemsets c? Ck do for all(k-1)-subsets s of c do  Stock code Date  Maximum price  Closing price  Increasing rate  Increasing rate of one day later  600000 01/02/2008 22.96 22.32 1.41  -5.06 600015 01/11/2008 22.58 22.58 10.20  1.06 600104 11/27/2008 4.63 4.46 6.19  -1.79    if (s?Lk-1) then delete c from Ck;  function subset() among Apriori algorithm is  for all frequent k-itemset lk,k 2 do begin  H1={lk };  call ap_genrules(lk,H1);  end;  procedure ap_genrules(lk: frequent k-itemset, Hm: assembly of consequent in m items)  if (k>m+1)then begin  Hm+1= apriori_gen(Hm);  for all hm+1? Hm+1 do begin conf=support(lk)/support(lk-hm+1);  if(comf minconf) then  output rule (lk-hm+1) hm+1  with confidence=conf and support=support(lk);  else  delete hm+1from Hm+1;  end;  call ap_genrules(lk,Hm+1);  end.



V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT AND ANALYSIS The download data is transformed to table format by  EXCEL in this paper. Then the data is lead-in MATLAB 7.0.

Classical Apriori algorithm is implied by programming function of MATLAB. The results are expressed in table II, table III and table IV.

TABLE II.  ASSOCIATION RULE RESULTS ON LEVEL-1  Relation Affairs Support Confidence  X Y Day raising limit and raising a day later 52.9% 61.7%  X Z Day raising limit and  raising five days later  51.1% 60.2%  X W Day raising limit and  price differential >2% a day later  48% 71.1%  The results in table II show that raising limit influences raising a day later and raising five days later and price differential >2% a day later. There are 61.7% stocks raising a day later and 60.2% stocks raising five days later. Obviously there are 71.1% stocks which maximum price greater than opening price 2% a day later. This result shows that there is an investment chance in a day later.

Different trading volume influences stock raising trend after raising limit.

Table IV and figure 2 show that different trading volume influences stock raising trend after raising limit in different way, obviously the probability of raising a day later and the probability of raising five days later deduce gradually with trading volume amplifying, only the probability of maximum price greater than opening price 2% a day later raise gradually.

The stocks of raising limit of trading volume deducing have larger probability to the stocks of raising limit of trading volume amplifying. But in the next day the opening price of these stocks of raising limit of trading volume deducing is mostly too high leading to its invest value is too low. But if there is a chance to involve, its invest value is so high. The probability of stocks of raising limit of trading volume amplifying 100% is lower relatively. We should avoid involving and invest the money in the stocks of raising limit of trading volume deducing or amplifying mildly.



VI. CONCLUSIONS This paper analyses the relation of raising limit and raising  rate later and find out the regularity in it by using multi-level association rule. The raising probability is higher than 60% or 70% shows that this is a massage for investor to operate in short time. Investor must pay attention to the trading volume.

The stocks of raising limit by trading volume amplifying large  always have bad expression later. It shows that large trading volume leads to energy releasing fully then influences raising trend later. The stocks of raising limit of petty trading volume always have good expression later. Its energy release insufficiently. But common investors buy it difficultly. If there is a chance it will be a very good chance.
