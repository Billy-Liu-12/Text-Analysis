I. INTRODUCTION The development of Chinese emerging industries with  strategic importance has been demanding increasingly for engineering and technical talents with professional skills, innovative spirit and collaboration capabilities, and it is an irresistible trend for engineering education the application of intelligent information technology in the CDIO engineering teaching mode and the full realization of network and intelligent teaching. In this paper the model of intelligent navigation system for network course learning has been constructed based on the network teaching platform using the Apriori algorithm of mining technique of association rules in combination with the engineering education concept of CDIO, which can find the frequent access paths during the learning process according to the individual information of students so as to provide them with suitable learning path, guide students to study independently, improve the learning efficiency and promote the development of engineering and technical talents.



II.    OVERALL STRUCTURE ANALYSIS AND DESIGN The intelligent navigation model of network course  learning is a learning process of determining correct learning content and finding outing a suitable knowledge point by using the mining algorithm of association rules on the basis of the curriculum knowledge base and in accordance with the individual information of students so as to constantly provide students with intelligent navigation service that is suitable for the individuality of each student. The method  principle and navigation principle of associated learning route have been used in the overall structure design of the intelligent navigation system model of network course learning put forward by this paper. The system model is mainly divided into four modules, as shown in Fig.1:   Fig.1 Intelligent Navigation System Model  The first module is the individualized information of students, which is used to collect the static information such as basic information and learning features of students, as well as the dynamic information such as learning record and cognitive level etc. The second is the curriculum knowledge base module. Logically speaking, it is consisted of knowledge level library and knowledge associated library, which uses the idea of knowledge association structure and knowledge model building. The third one is the web mining module, which is used to carry on the Web data mining to the information of students and related information of curriculum knowledge collected by the Apriori algorithm of association rules. The fourth one is the intelligent navigation engine generation module, which is used to synthesize the results of Web mining data and associated knowledge structure given by association database, and present students in the form of the navigation sequences or navigation chart with visualized technology. When student enters into the navigation system, his individual identity will be identified   DOI 10.1109/ICICEE.2012.521       by this system through the login information, and the data results, knowledge level library and learning behavior will be integrated together in the learning content pages by the navigation engine. The navigation results will be presented on the learning interface, and which is used to provide auxiliary references for students.



III.    INTELLIGENT NAVIGATION STRATEGIES In this paper, the intelligent navigation system model has  adopted the following navigation strategies: ? Related knowledge should be put together for study  and the order of difficulty degree of knowledge should also be considered, which is in order to prevent learners from careless jumping learning during the online learning process.

? When determining the next knowledge learning goals, the system analyzes the characteristics of knowledge learning route according to individual needs and learning features and then gives the navigation lists of knowledge for students to choose by themselves.

? The system analyzes the knowledge relevance in discipline knowledge repository, considers static and dynamic information in the individualized model of users, and uses the algorithm of association rules to find out the next possibly suitable knowledge points.



IV.    WEB MINING MODULE DESIGN  A. Apriori Algorithm of Association Rules Association Rules mining is an important subject in the  research field of data mining. Apriori algorithm is the most influential algorithm in mining association rules of Boolean type with frequent set. The algorithm mines the association rules by two stages of connecting and pruning, and finds frequent set by the gradual increase in the number of item sets elements, then finds association rules based on frequent sets. The specific procedures are: Firstly, scan transaction database to obtain a candidate set C1 which contains 1 project. Then, seek the project frequency set L1 -equal to or greater than the minimum support degree 1 - in C1. Use L1 to connect with itself and generate candidate set C2. Then find the project frequency set L2 which contains 2 projects with minimal support degree in C2. The procedure works as above on and on until the elements can not be expanded.

Mine the management rules according to minimum confidence after getting all frequency elements (marked as L)  Stage 1: Generating frequent item sets.

Apriori Core algorithm is described as below: Input: Affairs database D, minimum support degree  threshold min_sup.

Output: Frequent item sets L in D.

L1={find_frequent_1-item set s(D)} For(X=2?LX 1<>??X++)do begin  CX=A priori_gen(LX+1?min_sup) For all tranctions?D do begin  C1=subset(CX?t) For all candidates c?C1 do begin  c.count++ end  end LX={c(CX|c.count>=min_sup}  end effect=UXLX Stage 2: Produce association rules according to frequent  set.

Input: Frequent item sets L and minimum confidence  value (marked as min conf).

Output: Association rules.

For each of the frequent item sets 1 in L, produce all the  nonvoid subset of 1.

For each nonvoid subset s in 1, if the result of the  support degree of 1 divided by s is greater than or equal to minimum confidence, write down Support(I)/support(s)? min conf, the output rules S? (1-S); Otherwise no output.

B. Realization Steps of Web Mining Technology  Web mining technology in this system model is completed mainly through five steps of data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, and mining implementation algorithm and mode analysis.

1) Data collection. Store the visit information in the data warehouse in the server through information collection in the module in individualized information of students. Store the information collected through knowledge relevance library and knowledge relevance library in relevance database.

2) Data preprocessing. It processes the flow of information clearing, user?s identification, user?s session, transaction. Firstly, purify the log data and record them with the extension names asp, html, gif, avi, etc. keep main teaching content such as web pages, video and use SQL to delete image files used for beautifying; Then identify the users, make student access information for each period of time a user session; Finally decompose the users into certain semantic access sequence for transaction identification.

3) Data storage. Store the data after pretreatment in affairs database.

4) Implement mining algorithm. Through the Apriori introduced above, find covert and valuable relations between the given data set.

5) Visualization. Through the visualization technology, integrate the data result of mining, knowledge level libraries and learning behavior into the page of learning content and present them to learners on study interface, providing personalized navigation.

The Processing Realization of Web Mining Algorithm Module           TAB.1 WEB BROWSING BUSINESS SET D  Tid Affairs Content  074 A.html B.html C.html  075 A.html B.html C.html D.html  076 A.html B.html E.html  077 H.html G.html  078 G.html A.html E.html V.html  ? ? ? ? ?  From the server?s Web log, collect students? access path information when the students visit the course of computer composition principle, implement of data processing and store in affairs database after data implementation and extract learning paths of chapter four input/output system from some students. Among them, A.html is the 4.1 section input/output system overview, B.html is the 4.2 section I/O interface, C.htm is the 4.3 section program inquires way, D.html is the 4.4 section program interrupt mode, E.html is the 4.5 section the DMA mode, H.html is the 4.6 section the I/O devices, and G.html is the summary of this chapter, generating Web access business set D. As shown in Table 1, there are five affairs records. Pre-define minimum support value as 2 and minimum threshold confidence as 60%.

Algorithm L1 is a frequent item set of k-. Every member in LK includes k - item sets supports two domains; Ck is the item set collection candidate k - item sets collections, each member of which includes k - quote, supporting two fields.

Form the affairs set D through the connection of the web browsing affairs in Table? and further get candidate set C1 by scanning D. Compare the support degree of set items in C1 and predefined support degree 2. For the set items that do not meet the minimum support degree, prune them to get L1; Repeat connection, the pruning operation, which in turn gets candidate set C2, L2 and so on. Repeat until element number cannot be expanded. As Fig.2 shows:   Fig.2 Apriori Algorithm Path Search Process  Frequent item sets l = {A, B, C} generates association rules, the nonvoid subsets of 1 are {A}, {B}, {C}, {A, B}, {A, C} and {B, C}, the results of association rules are as follows, calculate the last results of confidence threshold value. Delete the records B?A?C that are less than the minimum confidence threshold value and get the final association rules. Because the predefined confidence threshold value is 60% which cannot be outputted, from strong rules, the conclusion can be drawn, then store in the data Table ?.

TAB.2 TABLE OF DATA CONCLUSION  Association Rules Confidence Specific Content  A? B C?  67% When visit page A, the  possibility of visiting B and C is 67%.

C?A B?  100% When visit page C, the  possibility of visiting A and B is 100%.

A B? ? C 67% When visit page A and B,  the possibility of visiting C is 67%.

A C? ? B 100% When visit page A and C,  the possibility of visiting B is 100%.

B C? ?A 100% When visit page B and C,  the possibility of visiting A is 100%.

Through the application of Apriori algorithm, the system finds the path information of students visiting network teaching platform and gets the learning path that is visited repeatedly, and combining the level and structure connection of old and new knowledge, which will provide students with       different types of navigation with the visualization technology.



V.     CONCLUSIONS Based on the idea of CDIO, the intelligent navigation  system model has been constructed in this paper based on the network teaching platform, which the Web data mining has been carried on using the mining Apriori algorithm of association rules. When students are learning independently on the network platform, the navigation system can do classification according to different students' academic record and program tastes, and provide students with different types of navigation charts combining with the links between knowledge points uploaded by teachers, which will play a certain guiding role in students? study. With the development of data mining technology, further analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of algorithm, to continue to explore and build intelligent learning platform, and to play the positive role of network intelligent teaching in cultivating engineering technology talents are still needed.
