Reality mining in urban space

Abstract?The widespread adoption of smartphones and other sensor-capable devices and the availability of infras- tructure capable of storing and sharing sensor information have been the main enablers for the intriguing and ambitious concept of Reality Mining. Reality mining is concerned with the collection and analysis of sensed data pertaining to different aspects of human social behavior, allowing to observe the societal dynamics and predict what individuals will do next, model the behavior of large organizations, detect trends, spot emerging phenomena and events, mine public opinion, etc. The concept of reality mining is even more intriguing when applied in the context of urban space, since user-generated content can be analyzed to reveal the citizens? perspective on various aspects of the city reality. In this paper, after elaborating on the concept of reality mining in urban space, we present three cases where user-generated content is employed to discover the citizens? perspective about: a) the city attractions, b) the city issues/problems, and c) major events in the city.

I. INTRODUCTION  It is only recently that sensor information has become very  commonplace due to the widespread availability of smart-  phones and other mobile sensor-capable devices. The fact  that sensor data are typically weaved into mainstream social  media platforms allows their combination with other online  data such as text streams and updates, photos and videos. For  instance, GPS, physiological, vibration, direction and health  sensors applications (e.g. Garmin Connect1, EveryTrail2)  collect user-contributed sensory information in real-time  or a posteriori, and allow their users to share it together  with other forms of social content. This unprecedented  flood of data provides us with the opportunity to make  decisions based on the data itself, rather than on guesswork,  or on artificially constructed models of reality. Therefore,  harnessing such data carries the potential to be the main  enabler of Reality Mining by driving nearly every aspect  of our modern society, including mobile services, retail,  manufacturing, financial services, life and natural sciences.

Reality mining is concerned with the collection and anal-  ysis of sensed data pertaining to human social behavior [1].

By collecting and aggregating the data streams generated  1http://connect.garmin.com/ 2http://www.everytrail.com/  from smartphone installed sensors (e.g. physiological mea-  sures, GPS tracks, proximity, location, and activity infor-  mation) and combining them with user-generated content  (UGC), we are able to gain insight into the dynamics of  both individual and group behavior [2]. Such dynamics can  help us predict what a single user will do next, model the  behavior of large organizations, detect trends, spot emerging  phenomena and events, mine public opinion, etc. What is  particularly interesting in this case is the fact that mobile and  social network citizens can act as the living sensors of their  city, its social aspects, its cultural events or even its mobility  status by doing no more than their everyday activities.

Following the principles of pervasive computing the reality  mining concept promises a plentiful and particularly rich  content allowing to grasp the actual footprint of a living  society in almost real time.

Equipped with such powerful features, the concept of  reality mining proves to be useful in various application  domains in urban space including: mobility, where the  GPS tracks of citizens? routes can reveal the status of  traffic congestion and facilitate real-time traffic planning [3];  tourism and culture, where uploaded media can reveal ?off-  the-beaten-path? points of interest and events, otherwise hard  to discover [4]; politics, where UGC may contain up-to-date  information reflecting the popularity of election candidates  and their support among populations [5]; economics, mar-  keting and brand monitoring, where the number of related  media uploaded online can reflect the number and locations  of products sold in the market [6]. The existence of big  data streams coupling UGC with machine-sensed data and  the ability to process them in large scale make feasible the  extraction of the aforementioned reality aspects.

However, in achieving the ambitious objective of reality  mining, a number of challenges need to be addressed, either  stemming from the requirement to capture and process  the large volume of data, which are expected to grow as  the number of living sensors increases, or pertaining to  ethical constraints, since data privacy and protection should  be seriously taken into consideration when capturing the  environmental and activity context of individuals.



II. CHALLENGES FOR REALITY MINING IN URBAN SPACE  UGC produced in urban space is complex. This is due  to the variety of data that it encompasses, ranging from  structured data, such as logged transactions or stored mea-  surements, to unstructured data such as text conversations,  multimedia presentations and video streams, as well as due  to the speed at which it is delivered and used. In using this  content, we may identify the following challenges:  Heterogeneity and Incompleteness that call for novel  data collection, fusion and aggregation methods able to  combine largely different modalities coming from different  sources. Such methods are necessary for exploiting the full  potential of sensor information that is distributed across  many sharing platforms.

Scale and Timeliness that raise the need for scalable  and efficient data stream mining, information extraction,  indexing and retrieval approaches. Such approaches need  to be able to process the vast amount of data in a time  interval acceptable by the application, leading to live analyt-  ics and useful information that is usually hidden in implicit  relations. In many cases, since the sensors are embedded  in smartphones, efficient (pre-)processing should take place  in the constrained environment of the smartphone, creating  distributed computing architectures.

Privacy relating to the fact that given the nature of  big data streams (i.e. generated by use of smartphones  and shared through social networks) the vast majority of  potential services involves the storage and processing of  users? private information. The privacy-related challenges  are magnified by the fragmentation of existing policies on  handling private data and the absence of a clear European  directive on this issue. As a consequence users are reluctant  to hand over their personal information, while researchers  face many difficulties in collecting them at adequate scales.



III. PROPOSED APPROACH  In meeting those challenges and harnessing the power  of UGC to facilitate reality mining, we have successfully  integrated data mining technologies with software solutions  for large-scale data storage and processing. More specifi-  cally, we have developed the necessary back-end and front-  end infrastructures to: a) collect and store user-generated  multimedia data, b) perform the necessary processing so as  to extract and exploit the collective intelligence hidden in  such data, and c) engage citizens through attractive interfaces  in both mobile and web platforms.

More specifically, with respect to the heterogeneity of the  collected data we have incorporated in the proposed frame-  work novel methods [7], [8] for jointly handling images  and text, which are typically the most frequent resources  contributed by users. In the first case [7], the rationale is  to project the features extracted from the heterogeneous  resources into a new space (e.g. space of probabilities) where  all data samples can be treated seamlessly. In the latter [8],  visual and textual features of user-contributed images are  fused by use of a similarity graph, employed for clustering.

For coping with scalability and real-time processing re-  quirements, we rely on the best practices for distributed pro-  cessing and storage, such as the MapReduce [9] and the MPI  (Message Passing Interface) paradigms, and the schema-less  auto-sharding MongoDB database3 for enabling flexible data  modelling and horizontal scaling. Computational efficiency  is also achieved at the level of image processing where  highly optimized compact image descriptors are employed  to power similarity search [10]. Finally, for dealing with  privacy-related challenges we make sure to inform users  about the potential usage of their data, as well as to obtain  their consent before collecting any information. Moreover,  when using shared data (e.g. Flickr images), appropriate  licenses are selected that permit content reuse and redis-  tribution (e.g. Creative Commons licenses4).

Based on the above technologies, we present three cases,  where reality mining has been applied on UGC to mine  certain aspects of urban reality, namely, city attractions, city  issues/problems, and major events that take place in the city.



IV. CASE STUDIES  A. Mining the city attractions  The first case study involves an application that applies  multimedia mining techniques on large amounts of UGC  to discover interesting areas, places of interest (POIs) and  events in a city5. The application employs a two-level  clustering scheme on very large collections of geotagged  images collected from Flickr. At the first level, images are  automatically clustered by location into areas or districts  of interest (e.g. Downing street in the city of London).

Then, at a finer clustering level, images of the same district  are clustered around landmarks and events, and titles are  extracted for each cluster based on the metadata of the  associated images. The entire process takes place in a fully  automatic way enabling the creation of online city guides  at a global scale. More details about the techniques behind  this application can be found in [8]. A set of 40 cities are  currently included in the application. A snapshot from the  mobile app UI is presented in Figure 1.

B. Mining the city issues/problems  In modern societies there is a growing requirement for  public administrations to directly communicate with their  citizens, view the existing problems from their perspective  and react to their needs. To this end, smartphones have  turned into a valuable instrument that, apart from being  a source of rich information, is also an integral part of  our daily activities. Based on the above and driven by the  3http://www.mongodb.org/ 4http://creativecommons.org/ 5http://www.clusttour.gr/    Figure 1. Spots identified in a city  intriguing concept that citizens can act as living sensors of  their city, our second use case consists of a user-friendly  mobile application that enables them to directly report  administration problems (or suggestions) about their city,  such as potholes, illegal trash dumping, faulty street lights,  broken tiles on sidewalks, and illegal advertising boards. The  issues submitted by citizens are subsequently transmitted,  through the back-end infrastructure, to the appropriate office  in public administration so as to schedule their settlement.

The main functionalities offered by the application6 in-  clude: a) a map-based and a list-based view of the reported  issues (Figure 2) that are also supported by filtering mecha-  nisms, allowing the user to quickly obtain an overview of the  existing problems, b) a ?new issue? reporting functionality  that allows the user to easily describe, locate, visualize and  submit an issue, c) a mechanism for all registered users to  comment on reported issues or give their positive vote, and  e) a feedback mechanism for informing the citizens about  the current progress of their issues.

The mobile application communicates with an integrated  back-end environment for managing the incoming issues.

This environment provides the necessary interfaces for ob-  taining an overview of the reported issues and understanding  the citizens? perspective. Finally, reality mining is also  facilitated through the generation of statistically aggregated  information, in time and space, that allows the city officials  to assess the overall performance of the municipality and  plan for future resources.

Reality mining about major events in a city  The third case study pertains to a platform that enhances  the experience of people attending large events, such as  festivals, by enabling the extraction of rich insights with  respect to the impact of such events to their attendants.

More specifically, the proposed platform includes a mo-  bile app targeted at the event of interest and a server-  side data mining component that processes the streams of  social media focused on the event and the inputs of event  attendants contributed through the app. The mobile app  facilitates rapid lookup of the festival program and enables  users to create personalized views of the program. More  importantly, the app enables users to give feedback on the  event, e.g. in the case of a film festival, users can rate and  comment on the screened films (see Figure 3). The server-  side component aggregates user ratings and bookmarks to  derive popularity rankings of films. At the same time, it  monitors the Twitter stream for messages related to the  festival and employs text mining to automatically match  them to films, discover emerging topics, and detect their  sentiment (positive/negative/neutral). More technical details  on the implementations of these approaches and their as-  sessment are available in [11].

By combining and mining these two sources (mobile app  inputs and Twitter stream), the developed event platform  helps event organizers to obtain a succinct and informative  view of the event in question. For instance, in the case of  the recent Thessaloniki International Film Festival (TIFF53)  Figure 4 provides a summary of the Twitter activity in    Figure 3. Mobile app for festivals  Figure 4. Twitter activity during TIFF53  tandem with the most important topics detected by mining  online discussions. In addition, it can provide lists of top  ranked films, topics, shared URLs, and media content. In  some cases, the platform could help organizers identify po-  tential problems (e.g. attendants? complaints about services  offered in the event vicinity) and understand what people  like in the event.



V. CONCLUSION  Reality mining is an intriguing and ambitious concept that  has only started to attract the attention of researchers due to  the abundant availability of user generated sensor data and  content. Researchers are intrigued by the opportunities and  potential of real-time urban data, including the capturing  of city landmarks, issues and the citizens? experiences in  the context of large events. Nevertheless, in order for such  data to lead to meaningful conclusions, they need to be  captured and analyzed in large scale, giving rise to certain  challenges associated with the nature of such data. The appli-  cations presented in this paper demonstrate how data mining  technologies can be combined with large-scale multimedia  storage and processing approaches to mine large amounts of  UGC and gain insights into different aspects of urban reality.
