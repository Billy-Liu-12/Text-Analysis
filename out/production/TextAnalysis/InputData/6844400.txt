Dynamic Perception Rule Acquirement for  Incomplete Data

Abstract?Modern science is increasingly data-driven and collaborative in nature. Comparing to ordinary data processing, big data processing that is mixed with great missing date must be processed rapidly. Considering this requirement this paper proposes a dynamic perception rule acquirement algorithm to implement fast and accurate information decision supporting model for incomplete data. It is inevitable that information contains incomplete data, and huge information being processing require fast algorithm to complete knowledge extraction. The method based on dynamic perception rule can achieve automatic analysis and intelligent cognition for the information decision supporting. Based on direction of maximum entropy at any moment, the perception rule can improve the recognition rate.

Furthermore the dynamic perception rule adopts the tolerant relation to accommodate the incomplete data processing capability. The simulative analysis of diesel engine fault shows that the dynamic perception rule can achieve fast information decision supporting and the accuracy is certainly improved even for incomplete data.

I. INTRODUCTION IBM estimates that every day 2.5 quintillion bytes of data  are created ? so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years. [1] Big data is not only becoming more available  but also more understandable to computers. But there are more challenges in big data period that great volume unstructured data must be rapidly processed and analyzed. Unstructured data refers to informat ion that either does not have a pre-defined data model or missing data.

Rough-set theory, proposed by Pawlak and Skowron[2,10], has become a well-established mechanism for uncertainty management in a wide variety of applications related to unstructured data.[11,12] In this framework, an attribute set is viewed as a granular space, which partit ions the universe into some knowledge granules or elemental concepts. In most information decision supporting problem, the decision is taken based on known values of information attribute repressed by  the vector 1 2[ , , , ]nA a a a? , ]n, . The goal of decision supporting  is to determine if the state x belongs to decision jd or not, 1,2j m? m . [13] But in practice the information system  maybe miss some feature values of the state, such as medical or industrial diagnosis, which is due to the imposs ibility of performing some detects.[14] In  the past ten years, for the incomplete informat ion data, several extensions of the rough- set model have been accomplished, in which the rough set model based on tolerance relation was[3,4]. Those models can solve the decision supporting problem or classification. But some decision supporting can make certain deduction only using partition feature values.[15,16] In industrial diagnosis, the classifier can work in the online process monitoring. The failure of some measuring elements does not have to cause stopping the process if the values given by the rest of the measuring elements are enough to make a decision such that the process is performing properly. When available information is not sufficient then the system must take some model to deal with this condition. The most importance for those is as soon as possible deducing the decision, such as medical or mechanism fault diagnosis.[18,19,20]  This paper proposes a dynamic perception rule acquirement algorithm to implement fast and accurate information decision supporting model for incomplete data, which can achieve automatic analysis and intelligent cognition for the maximum dynamic entropy for various feature values set.



II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Central to fuzzy rough set rule generation is the concept of  fuzzy indiscernibility. Here let U denote a finite and non-empty set called the universe. And A  is a non-empty finite set of attributes such that : aa U V? for every a A? .With every subset of attribute B A? there are an indiscernibility relation:  2( ) {( , ) | , ( ) ( )}IND B x y U a B x a y a? ? ? ? ?     (1) Using [ ]Bx we denote the equivalence class of ( )IND B  including x . Given an arbitrary set X U? , one can characterize X by a pair of lower and upper approximations. The lower  approximat ion RX  is the greatest definable set contained in X , and the upper approximation RX is the least definable set containing X . Formally, the lower and upper approximation can be defined as follows: [5]  { | [ ] }R RX x x X? ?                  (2) { | [ ] }R RX x x X? ? 	}	               (3)  This work is supported by The National Nature Science Foundation of China No. 61172117.

PXP                       (4) Fuzzy Rough Set was firstly proposed by Dubois and Prade  [6] and then studied in [7]. Suppose U is a nonempty universe (may not be finite) and R is a binary fuzzy relation on U , then the fuzzy approximation operators can be summarized as follows. For every fuzzy set ( )A F U? [8]  ( ) sup ( ( , ), ( ))T u U  R A x T R x u A u ?  ?     (5)  ( ) inf ( ( ( , )), ( ))S u UR A x S N R x u A u??            (6) Here a triangular norm, or shortly T -norm, is a function T :  [0,1] [0,1] [0,1] ?  that satisfies the following conditions: monotonicity [if ,x y? ?  ,then ( , ) ( , )T x y T ? ?? ], commutativity [ ( , ) ( , )T x y T y x? ] , associatity [ ( ( , ), ) ( , ( , ))T T x y z T x T y z? ], and boundary condition [ ( ,1)T x x? ]. The most popular continuous T -norm include the standard min operator ( , ) min{ , }MT x y x y? and the bounded intersection ( , ) max{0, 1}LT x y x y? ? ? .[8]  A triangular conorm, or shortly T -conorm, is a increasing, commutative, and associative function S : [0,1] [0,1] [0,1] ? that satisfies the boundary conditions: [0,1]x? ? , ( ,0)S x x? .

The most well-known continuous T -conorm include the standard max operator ( , ) max{ , }MS x y x y? and bounded sum  ( , ) min{1, }LS x y x y? ? . [9]

III. DYNAMIC PERCEPTUAL RULE ACQUIREMENT ALGORITHM  Fuzzy Rough set can use the attribute reduction and rule generation to solve the decision supporting for many practical application such as medical or system fault diagnosis.[10] But conventional algorithm could not consider the prediction cueing information in order to abridge the attribute acquirement for the economic and temporal reason. This letter presents an algorithm with dynamic perceptual rule acquirement for decision supporting system. This novel algorithm would shorten the attribute acquirement steps and achieve high accuracy and efficiency, which is shown:  Step1: Build the Fuzzy Equivalence Relation, which  can be used to evaluate the resemble degree for two information system sample on the universe.

Step 2: Compute the Fuzzy Judgment Subjection Degree, which needs suit to the information judgment table data. The perceptual rule defines the formula as  2min(exp( )), 1,2, ,4 i ix xD i n ? ?  ? ?i (D i ( ,n,               (7)  ix is the value i of attribute, and ix is the mean value for this attribute. The ? is the variance for all attributes value.

Step 3: Analyze the Dynamic Perceptual Cue, which is computed considering of the already attribute information ja ??    /{{ }{ , }}  /{ , }  ( ( )) ( | ( ))  ( ( )) j i j  i j  U a a a d j p  U a a  card FPOS D FSig a R x  card FPOS D ? ?  ?  ? ? 1  (}}1 (}}  }1 (}1 (}  ))}} ( ))  )) }} (}}  (8)  Here the FPOS is the fuzzy equivalence relation the position, whose formula is  1/{ , } / ( ) min( ( ))  i jU a a X U R FPOS D X D  ? ? ?}1 (} ( ) i ( ( ))) i ( () i ( ((min(i (i (     (9)  And card is member number for the set.

Step 4: After computing all the no-value attributes dynamic importance, the perceptual rule can be generated based on the dynamic perceptual cue. The perceptual rule form is  1 1( , ) ( , ) ( , )i i i i i n i n ja v a v a v a? ? ? ? ?i(( ) (( ) () (1 1( , ) ( ,, ) ( ,, ) ( ,1 1i i n ii i n i1 1, ) ( ,,, ) ( ,1 1, ) ( ,,,, ) ( ,1 1     (10) Step: Then system can arrange the system state information  detection order for decision supporting. If the input information is incomplete, the fuzzy tolerance relation is taken for computing the perceptual cue.

2{( , ) | , ( ) ( ) ( ) (*)}T x y U a B x a y a x a y? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (11) Step 6: After obtaining new system states, decision  supporting system evaluates the fuzzy judgment. If the judgment subjection degree is beyond the threshold, system takes the judgment. Otherwise system re-generates the perceptual rule for next information index order.

This algorithm recognizes the maximum probability for decision making by the already attribute information, which is called as the perceptual cue informat ion. And this information can make the rule to help system find the optimal information acquirement sequences which will reduce the information index compute and improve the decision supporting accuracy.



IV. EXPERIMENTS For evaluating the Dynamic Perception Rule Acquirement  for industrial fault detection, this paper presents a simulation which compares the Dynamic Perceptual rule and attribution importance. Attribution importance is the statistical measurement, which is  /{{ }{ }} /{{ }( ( )) ( ( )) ( ( )) ( ( ))  j i i n i i nU a a a U a a card POS D card POS D  Sig card POS D card POS D  ? ?? ? (}}(}} (}(})) d ))}} {{ }( )) ( ( ))  )) i n i i nU /{{/{{  d)) ( ()) ( ( ?  }} (}} }(}     (12)  This simulation takes the diesel engine malfunction as the fault detection system, which can discover eight malfunctions using eight detection parameters. These eight malfunctions are 100% offering ( 1T ), 75% offering ( 2T ), 25% offering ( 3T ), id le consume ( 4T ), pin valve block ( 5T ), valve jam ( 6T ), p in valve leak ( 7T ) and exceed oil valve invalidation ( 8T ). These eight detection parameters are most pressure ( 1P ), hypo- most pressure ( 2P ), wave range ( 3P ), ascend edge width ( 4P ), wave width ( 5P ), most aftereffect width ( 6P ), wave area ( 7P ) and spout pressure ( 8P ). With the experiment the diesel engine malfunction decision information table is:     Through analyzing this table the statistic character can be gotten. There are three cluster parameter centers, which are  1[ 0.79meanV ? var1, 0.22]V ? , 2[ 0.06meanV ? ? var 2, 0.21]V ? and 3[ 0.66meanV ? ? var3, 0.15]V ? .

The rule fo llowing fault detection information can be obtained from the intelligent extraction step and equations of dynamic perceptual rule. For example, in the known state P1 conditions and according to the attributes importance, the detection rule is:  1 6 3 8 2 7 4 5P P P P P P P P? ? ? ? ? ? ? 13 The dynamic perceptual rules in this paper is followed  1 1 3  5 4 6 8 2 7  meanP V P P P P P P P  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 14  1 2 3 5  4 6 8 2 7  meanP V P P P P P P P  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 15  1 3 4  3 5 6 8 2 7  meanP V P P P P P P P ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 16  TABLE I.

Such directions are more suitable for perceptual mechanism of the biosphere so the fault detection accuracy and efficiency can be caught.

From the above analyzing, it is easily drown that dynamic perceptual rule can offer more detail in order to decision supporting processing more intelligent and efficient. The simulation system tests different date with variant system noise to evaluate the result of dynamic perceptual rule and attribute importance. Fig 1 shows the system judgment results on 0.21 system noise with 0.2 attibute incomplete.

Within the same signal-to-noise ratio data, the accuracy of the fault detection analysis based on this rule that is higher than from regular attribute rules. This method could improve the fault detection efficiency.

Figure 5 and figure 6 shows the simulation result for incomplete data. In this simulation the attribute incomplete is seted 4% to 40% for whole test data. The simulation results show that the dynamic perception rules can improve the fault detection accuracy and efficiency. Due to take the maximum dynamic information entropy this algorithm can achieve more better dicision surpporting.



V. CONCLUSION Considering  the incomplete data system more e xisting big  data era, this paper presents a dynamic perception rule acquirement algorithm that can deal the incomplete, ambiguity and the inconsistency of system state. Based on direction of maximum entropy, the dynamic perception rule can improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency. The simulative analysis of diesel engine fault shows that the dynamic perception rules can achieve earlier re-warning for fau lt diagnosis information incomplete data systems and the accuracy is certainly improved.
